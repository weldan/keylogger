Install it as unpacked chrome web browser's extension:

It really simple as it is:

1. Download and unpack testkeylog folder in test machine, install it via chrome://extensions
2. Download and unpack testkeylog folder in your web server, your web server must server php if you want to 
use receiver.php, other than that feel free to write your receiver.*blah*
